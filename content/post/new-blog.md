Hello! I'm Daniel and this is my new blog.

<!--more-->

OK, maybe not so new. I had a blog on [Tumblr](http://teddydd-dev.tumblr.com/) about my gamedev adventures but it was not updated frequently.
I decided to move it to GitHub pages and start fresh using more lightweight Hugo static generator.

I'm going to write posts in English and in Polish. First tag will always be language. I'm going to copy
posts from my Tumblr blog here, but that's not a priority.

I'm going to write about programming, my gamedev stuff, my projects, nice tools I use but also about art and other
things.

# Why Hugo

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is static website generator written by spf13 in Go. It's singe binary
executable, pretty fast and easy to use. There is lot of free [themes](http://themes.gohugo.io/)
available. As person without experience in webdev I was able to pick and tweak the theme without
a hassle.
