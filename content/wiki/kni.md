*Koło Naukowe Informatyków* - IT science club that operates on IT and math faculty of [UMK](http://www.umk.pl/).
I'm a member of the club and I proposed that I design logo for it.

## Rejected projects

I had a lot of fun with the first one. Six white triangles on hexagon. You can see letters KNI written in this logo.
Well, my IT friends were not convinced :)

Second one is my personal favorite. It's a bit too similar to IBM logo though. It wasn't intentional,
I made sketch for this logo in [Playscii](http://vectorpoem.com/playscii/) using ASCII characters.

## Selected project

Sketch was made using awesome [Dotgrid](https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/dotgrid) tool.
Dotgrid allows you to play with simple geometric shapes and typography and that is pretty cool.
Then I cleaned up patch in vector graphics editor. I need to learn a lot about design but 
I'm happy with the result. It's simple and clean.
