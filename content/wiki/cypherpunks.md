> Must we all be Cypherpunks?

This is a title of  my exhibition that took place at
*Wydział Matematyki i Informatyki* faculty of UMK. 

The only piece showed during exhibition is wallpaper displayed at every lab computer.
It was showed during period of one month.

I give my thanks to WMiI's dean Danuta Rozpłoch-Nowakowska and LESK employees for making the project possible, as
well as to Marian Stępak - my lecturer. I created this project at his classes.
