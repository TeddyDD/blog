Currently in research/testing phase.

## Requirements

- *alphabetic* shorthand
- easy to learn
- use excising muscle memory if possible
- visually unambiguous characters 
- stroke should always end on the right side (can be mirrored for left-handed people)
- most common letters will have the simplest characters

Most common letters in Polish: `a, i, e, o, n, z, r, s, w`.
