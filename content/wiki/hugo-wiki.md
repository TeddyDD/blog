Hugo Wiki is template for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static generator I use.

I wrote is after I saw http://wiki.xxiivv.com/ and I decided I want something like this.
Of course my template is pretty simple, and not really well designed. I'm not into *web desing* so
I had to write something simple and maintainable.

Fortunately Hugo side of project was easy. Hugo has good documentation so writing templates was a breeze.
CSS was a **nightmare**.
