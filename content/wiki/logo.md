It's started at first year of university. We had assignment for sculpture classes to create sculpture made of paper.
I made this geometric abstract form.

{{< ig "/images/logo0.jpg" "sculpture" >}}

After few years I tried to recycle 3d model of this sculpture for something else. I realized it looks interesting when shaded with black and white.

{{< ig "/images/logo1.png" "simple" >}}

I like to experiment with this form, transform it and reuse.

{{< ig "/images/logo2.png" "logo-render" >}}

Currently I'm using simplified version:

{{< ig "/logo.svg" "log" >}}
