It's started at first year of university. We had assignment for sculpture classes to create sculpture made of paper.
I made this geometric abstract form.

After few years I tried to recycle 3d model of this sculpture for something else. I realized it looks interesting when shaded with black and white.

I like to experiment with this form, transform it and reuse.

Currently I'm using simplified version:
