Hi. The name’s *Daniel*. I'm visual artist and programmer
currently studying at Nicolas Copernicus University in Toruń, Poland.

I'm interested in creating interdisciplinary art combining traditional and digital
techniques, gamedev and programming. I consider myself *FOSS* advocate and
I strive to use only open source software.

My website is divided into two sections.
The **Log** is place where I will post about thins I'm working on, interesting events in my area or other articles that are related to *time*.
It's not really a *blog*, more like logbook or my own twitter without characters limit.

The **Wiki** contains **projects** that are at advanced or finished stage. There is also **notes** section where I will write about
my workflow, tools, projects and stuff not created by me.

You can find me on other platforms:
